# ao3-citation-generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redsummernight/ao3-citation-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redsummernight/ao3-citation-generator)

This user script generates citations for fan works on [Archive of Our Own](http://archiveofourown.org/).

Citations are automatically added to the information section at the top of each work/chapter page.

## Style

The script follows the [style guide](http://www.transformativeworks.org/how-to-cite-fan-works/) developed by
Karen Hellekson, editor of *Transformative Works and Cultures*, with some modifications:

- Fandom names on AO3 are not italicized, as they can contain [more than just the titles](http://archiveofourown.org/wrangling_guidelines/4) of the original media.
- Crossovers involving 4 or more fandoms are cited as "Multifandom". This limit is arbitrarily chosen.
- Work titles with [quotation](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/02/) or [punctuation](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/03/) marks use MLA rules.

## Installation

You need the browser extension [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Opera Next, Safari, Firefox)
